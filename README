INTRODUCTION:
  - Single-cloumn PBL model with aerosol/cloud physics 
  - Total Energy - Mass Flux scheme for PBL dynamics from Angevine et al. (2010) 
    (https://doi.org/10.1175/2010MWR3142.1)
  - Spectral (bin) model for aerosols and cloud microphysics
  - See files "microphysics_description.pdf" and "TEMF_description.pdf" for more details
    and sample outputs

BUILDING:
  - Execute "make" in the root folder (possibly modifying compile options)
  - Requires OpenMP

RUNNING:
  - "./atmosphericModel" in the root folder
  
OUTPUT/PLOTTING:
  - All variables are written to output/ every 15 minutes (can be modified in time_mod)
  - Visualization is done in Octave inside the output/ folder
  - Timeseries can be plot using "plotTimeseriesSurf.m"
    * For any field that's computed at all levels
    * Files are named <VARIABLE_NAME>.dat
    * e.g., "plotTimeseriesSurf('Km')" plots Eddy diffusion coefficients

BOUNDARY CONDITIONS:
  - Default is a 72-hour simulation of a marine boundary-layer 
    under strong subsidence (e.g. coast of California)
  - Cloud scheme turned off by default
    * Switch parameters_mod:model_aerosols to .true. to enable
  - Surface temperature (SST) definition:
    boundary_conditions_mod:surface_values()
  - Upper boundary potential temperature and subsidence velocity in parameters_mod
